    <h1>Privacy Policy for LactaMed</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: November 22, 2024</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: November 22, 2024</strong></p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p><strong>LactaMed does not collect, store, or share any personal data.</strong> This app operates entirely on your device without requiring user accounts, registration, or any form of data collection.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>LactaMed does not collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal information (names, email addresses, phone numbers)</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>Usage analytics</li>
        <li>Search history (except locally cached for offline use)</li>
        <li>Health information</li>
        <li>Any form of user tracking</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How the App Works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> Search results are cached locally on your device using AsyncStorage for offline access. This data never leaves your device.</li>
        <li><strong>No User Accounts:</strong> The app does not require or support user accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> We do not use any analytics services or tracking tools.</li>
        <li><strong>No Advertisements:</strong> The app is completely ad-free and does not use advertising identifiers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Source</h2>
    <p>LactaMed retrieves medication information from e-lactancia.org's public database. When you search for a medication:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The search query is sent directly to e-lactancia.org</li>
        <li>No personal information is included in these requests</li>
        <li>Results are cached locally on your device for 30 days</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>LactaMed only connects to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>e-lactancia.org:</strong> For medication safety data (no personal data is sent)</li>
        <li><strong>Our API server:</strong> Acts as a proxy to fetch medication data (no user data is collected or logged)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect any data, there is no risk of your personal information being compromised through our service. All cached data remains exclusively on your device and can be cleared at any time by uninstalling the app.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>LactaMed is intended for use by adults (breastfeeding mothers and healthcare providers). We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age, as we do not collect any user information at all.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect personal data, there is no personal information to access, modify, or delete from our servers. You can clear locally cached data by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clearing the app's cache in your device settings</li>
        <li>Uninstalling the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>Any updates to this privacy policy will be posted here with an updated revision date. Since we don't collect user data, we cannot notify users directly of changes.</p>

    <h2>Open Source</h2>
    <p>LactaMed's privacy practices can be verified through our open-source code available on GitHub.</p>
