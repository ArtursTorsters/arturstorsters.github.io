Summary

LactaMed does not collect, store, or share any personal data.
The app operates entirely on your device and does not require accounts, registration, or any form of data collection.

Personal information (names, email addresses, phone numbers)

Location data

Device identifiers

Usage analytics

Search history (except cached locally on your device)

How the App Works

Local Storage Only: Search results are cached locally using AsyncStorage for offline access. This data never leaves your device.

No User Accounts: No account creation or login is required.

No Analytics: We do not use analytics tools or tracking services.

No Advertisements: The app contains no ads and does not use advertising identifiers.

Data Source

LactaMed retrieves medication data from the public database at e-lactancia.org.

When you search for a medication:

Your search query is sent directly to e-lactancia.org

No personal information is included in the request

Results are cached locally on your device for 30 days

Third-Party Services

LactaMed connects only to:

e-lactancia.org — for medication safety information (no personal data is sent)

Our API server — used only as a proxy to fetch medication data (no user data is collected or logged)

Data Security

Because we do not collect any data, there is no risk of personal information being exposed through our service. All cached data stays on your device and can be cleared at any time by uninstalling the app or clearing the app cache.

Children’s Privacy

LactaMed is intended for adults (breastfeeding mothers and healthcare providers). We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13, as we do not collect user information at all.

Your Rights

Since we do not collect personal data, there is no personal information stored on our servers to access, modify, or delete.
You may clear locally cached data by:

Clearing the app’s cache via device settings

Uninstalling the app

Changes to This Policy

Updates to this policy will be posted here with a new revision date. Because we do not collect user data, we cannot notify users directly of changes.
